Within this experiment 25 participants performed a two-competing speaker paradigm. 
Participants were instructed to either attend to the left or right audio book. 
The paradigm consisted of five 10-minute blocks of audio book presentation. 
In each 10-minute block the participants own name was presented 10 times,
embedded within the to-be-ignored audio book. A 10-minute block could either 
be presented in the omnidirectional condition (both audio books were presented 
equally loud) or within the beamforming condition (the to-be-attended audio book 
was louder than the to-be-ignored audio book). The first 10-minute block was always 
presented in the omnidirectional condition whereas the conditions were alternated 
for the later four blocks, with one half of the participants starting with the 
omnidirectonal condition and the other half starting with the beamforming condition
